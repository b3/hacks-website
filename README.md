Description
===========

This is a collection of small **dirty** hacks I have written along the time
and that are all about creation of website or collection of HTML pages.

They are not guaranteed to work or even to be completed or even useful.

They are all written to be used as command line tool and with the least
dependency possible. They are mainly written in perl.

- `get-element` -- print specified HTML elements data (or attribute value)

- `htmltoc` -- generate table of contents from headings in (x)HTML

- `htmltree` -- print HTML tree

- `mkweb` -- create a static website using source and template files

- `set-element` -- replace specified HTML elements data with some given content

The one I used more is `mkweb` which is self documented: look at the code or
at the file [`mkweb.md`](mkweb.md) which is an automatic extraction of
it. This one is not written in perl but in GNU makefile.
