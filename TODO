=====

* Add support of comments (lines starting by # sign) in .keep and .ignore
  files

* Add a flag to disable tidy use

* Fix BUGS (grep FIXME *)

* Remove hard-link or add a simple way to toggle hard-link/real copy of html files

  When TEMPLATE is more recent than an .html file which need to be keeped and
  which is on the same filesystem as the destination file (thus is hard-linked
  only) the source file is reprocessed (KEEP_COPY). This may be time
  consuming.
  
  Every time a TEMPLATE is modified, such source files should be restamped so
  that they are newer. This is not really a bug, but more a kind of a bad
  behavior, or side effect of the use of hard link.
