=====

* Add (unit ?) tests

* Add support of comments (lines starting by # sign) in .keep and .ignore
  files

* Fix BUGS (grep FIXME *)

* Enhance content position determination in template file.

   Since we deal with HTML files, content should be determined by a specific
   id attribute of some tag and not through some free text stored in
   START_CONTENT and STOP_CONTENT variables.

   If that is how to be changed the *old* behavior should be preserved and the
   new one offered only through some flag variables.
   
* Complete behavior should be simplified.

* CMD_KEEP should be avoided to be more efficient.

   File action determination (determining if a file need to processed or
   copied) is ugly because it use a call to a process $(shell) make functions
   for each file in the DO_HTML variables.

   A more efficient way should be investigated. The most efficient way should
   determined that information only once.

* CMD_TEMPLATE should bed verified.

   See the FIXME before $(DESTINATION)/%.html target in mkweb source.
